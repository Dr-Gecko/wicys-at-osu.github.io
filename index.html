            <p>
                "WiCys presented great opportunities for me to join cybersecurity competitions.  It has really opened doors for me and shown me all about the different paths that cybersecurity could take me."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Attending BSides through WiCys was a great way to listen to people talk about cybersecurity projects they have been working on and unveil projects that have previously been confidential.  It was my first time attending a cybersecurity conference and it has influenced me to continue looking for similar opportunities in the future.  WiCys also provided an AirBnb for the club to stay at, which was a great way for me to get to know other members in the club.  I definitely felt closer to those members from fostering a relationship there durign teh conference days."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I participated with WiCys in the National Cyber League and I found it gave me a chance to learn different tools used in the cybersecurity world.  At the beginning, they taught me how to use each tool step by step, then I got to participate in an individual and team competition using the skills that I had learned.  Thank you WiCys for telling me about that competition!"
